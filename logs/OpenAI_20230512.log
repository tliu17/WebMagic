user:# Project Summary:

This project aims to develop a system to foster dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The system will allow employees to contribute to both existing operations and new ventures, promoting a dynamic, project-based work environment. This will be achieved through four main components: dual-role management, project management, reward and incentive management, and token economy management.

# Key Features:

Dual-role Management: Enables employees to manage their roles in both existing businesses and innovative ventures, fostering a diverse work experience.
Project Management: Functionality for creating, assigning, tracking, and completing projects to ensure smooth execution of tasks.
Reward and Incentive Management: Allows for the distribution of rewards and incentives based on employee performance, promoting a performance-based culture.
Token Economy Management: Manages the issuance, trading, and tracking of tokens, adding a unique incentive for employees.
Performance Aspects:

Scalability: With organizational growth, the system must scale up efficiently.
Availability: High system availability is critical to maintain seamless operations.
Security: Ensuring the confidentiality and availability of data is paramount.
Interface Requirements:

User Interface: The system will offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
System Interface: Compatibility with other corporate systems is necessary for seamless integration.
Constraints:

Legal: Compliance with data protection and privacy regulations is mandatory.
Technical: The system should align with the existing IT infrastructure.
Technology Stack:

The system will leverage various technologies such as PHP8.2 for backend, CockroachDB cloud for the database, Amazon S3 for storage, and Ethereum for blockchain operations. The frontend will be developed using PHP8.2 and Tailwind CSS. For containerization, Docker and Kubernetes will be used, and AWS will provide cloud services. GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD. The system will also integrate with various messenger APIs.

# Design Considerations:

The system will support dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The target users are the employees and managers within the organization. The platform will manage dual roles, projects, rewards, and token economy within the organization. The design will adhere to a color scheme featuring different shades of blue, green, off-white, and dark grey.

user:# Project Summary:

This project aims to develop a system to foster dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The system will allow employees to contribute to both existing operations and new ventures, promoting a dynamic, project-based work environment. This will be achieved through four main components: dual-role management, project management, reward and incentive management, and token economy management.

# Key Features:

Dual-role Management: Enables employees to manage their roles in both existing businesses and innovative ventures, fostering a diverse work experience.
Project Management: Functionality for creating, assigning, tracking, and completing projects to ensure smooth execution of tasks.
Reward and Incentive Management: Allows for the distribution of rewards and incentives based on employee performance, promoting a performance-based culture.
Token Economy Management: Manages the issuance, trading, and tracking of tokens, adding a unique incentive for employees.
Performance Aspects:

Scalability: With organizational growth, the system must scale up efficiently.
Availability: High system availability is critical to maintain seamless operations.
Security: Ensuring the confidentiality and availability of data is paramount.
Interface Requirements:

User Interface: The system will offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
System Interface: Compatibility with other corporate systems is necessary for seamless integration.
Constraints:

Legal: Compliance with data protection and privacy regulations is mandatory.
Technical: The system should align with the existing IT infrastructure.
Technology Stack:

The system will leverage various technologies such as PHP8.2 for backend, CockroachDB cloud for the database, Amazon S3 for storage, and Ethereum for blockchain operations. The frontend will be developed using PHP8.2 and Tailwind CSS. For containerization, Docker and Kubernetes will be used, and AWS will provide cloud services. GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD. The system will also integrate with various messenger APIs.

# Design Considerations:

The system will support dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The target users are the employees and managers within the organization. The platform will manage dual roles, projects, rewards, and token economy within the organization. The design will adhere to a color scheme featuring different shades of blue, green, off-white, and dark grey.

# Project Summary:

This project aims to develop a system to foster dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The system will allow employees to contribute to both existing operations and new ventures, promoting a dynamic, project-based work environment. This will be achieved through four main components: dual-role management, project management, reward and incentive management, and token economy management.

# Key Features:

Dual-role Management: Enables employees to manage their roles in both existing businesses and innovative ventures, fostering a diverse work experience.
Project Management: Functionality for creating, assigning, tracking, and completing projects to ensure smooth execution of tasks.
Reward and Incentive Management: Allows for the distribution of rewards and incentives based on employee performance, promoting a performance-based culture.
Token Economy Management: Manages the issuance, trading, and tracking of tokens, adding a unique incentive for employees.
Performance Aspects:

Scalability: With organizational growth, the system must scale up efficiently.
Availability: High system availability is critical to maintain seamless operations.
Security: Ensuring the confidentiality and availability of data is paramount.
Interface Requirements:

User Interface: The system will offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
System Interface: Compatibility with other corporate systems is necessary for seamless integration.
Constraints:

Legal: Compliance with data protection and privacy regulations is mandatory.
Technical: The system should align with the existing IT infrastructure.
Technology Stack:

The system will leverage various technologies such as PHP8.2 for backend, CockroachDB cloud for the database, Amazon S3 for storage, and Ethereum for blockchain operations. The frontend will be developed using PHP8.2 and Tailwind CSS. For containerization, Docker and Kubernetes will be used, and AWS will provide cloud services. GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD. The system will also integrate with various messenger APIs.

# Design Considerations:

The system will support dual-model talent development and organizational innovation. The target users are the employees and managers within the organization. The platform will manage dual roles, projects, rewards, and token economy within the organization. The design will adhere to a color scheme featuring different shades of blue, green, off-white, and dark grey.
